# Paatu Dabba
### Spend more time listening.

Paatu Dabba(பாட்டு டப்பா ) is Tamil for 'Song Box'. It aims to reduce time spent on copying songs between a group of people.

The application has three parts:

1. Podu (போடு, Tamil for 'Put') - upload your favourite audio files.
2. Paadu (பாடு, Tamil for 'Sing') - play your favourite audios.
3. Sudu (சுடு, Tamil slang for 'Steal') - download your favourite audios.
